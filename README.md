Opioid Crisis in New England Analysis


With a great acceleration of deaths by fentanyl overdose during the CoVid-19 pandemic, the United States are battling against synthetic opioids being smuggled inside the country and its dramatic consequences. By trying to understand the dynamics driving the fentanyl epidemic in the United States using a compartmental model, precious insights could be provided to policymakers to counter the social and economic effects illicit drugs have on the country as a whole.

OfÔ¨Åcial data show that fentanyl-related overdose deaths have spiked after 2012. According to our model, the main parameters impacting this concerning increase are the extremely high prescription opioids addiction rates, the loose recovery rate and, of course, the deadliness of fentanyl (being 50 times more potent than heroin). Tailor-made policies should account for the sensitivity of the fentanyl epidemic system to these factors, trying not to focus on a prohibitionist approach. In fact, drug seizures and bans should be applied with care: a restrictive policy might even increase the number of fentanyl deaths by overdose in the long run.

   These data, representing the number of deaths attributed to each of the three substances over 100,000 individuals
   As it can be seen from the figure, heroin deaths started to increase since the early 2010s. Despite growing earlier than fentanyl overdose deaths, the latter grew with a steep exponential tendency starting from 2013. In fact, deaths caused by fentanyl overdose increased by about 450% over the period 2014-2019. While in 2016 fentanyl continued to increase, heroin started to marginally decrease. Finally, for the whole 20-years period in consideration, prescription opioid deaths were stable, averaging over 3.5 deaths for each 100,000 individuals in the US.
